Given following prerequisites for this assignment:
1. use max 2 hours
2. runnable everywhere
3. do not use already available API clients

Cypress framework has been selected for the assignment,
together with special Cypress API testing plug-in which allows nice interactions with APIs.
Pure JavaScript was used to save time without implementation of any client for API.

Unfortunately, even with specific plug-ins Cypress is not good for WebSockets testing.
Only basic checks were implemented in tests just to show my understanding of JavaScript and used frameworks.
i.e. Mocha assert used in tests, but Cypress also has it own way with 'should' keyword.
